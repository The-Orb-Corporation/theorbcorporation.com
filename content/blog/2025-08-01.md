<h1>On Ducks in F Flat</h1>
On sundays I workshop an upcoming matrimony of 2 mallards. </br>
A nuptial bond I may still unfulfill. </br>
Christ posits no pragmatum that  can pilot birddom to bountiful joy.</br>
the risk is walloping, </br>
which in action wants fantastic study. </br>Contra our frights sit hopingly a bid at joy in wildfowl fusion. </br>If quarral disavails this duo, what authority wouldn't attack who in act did champion up knowingly highrisk position?</br> Succumb to migratory wim and doom a wonderful avian to sinful union? </br>Absurdist plans though may triumph, </br>for although I nix it out </br>in truthful notion it wouldn't plausibly hurt bad. </br>Duck matrimony -frankly- should fly to our God, </br>wobbling in climactic aclarity.
